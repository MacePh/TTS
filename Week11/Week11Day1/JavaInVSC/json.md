#JSON API Tutorial
Imagine that you have create an API, and that someone has requested information from

that API via an endpoint.


Either:

1. Write up a sample JSON response for that request using the JSON format specification.

Here is the JSON format specification:

https://jsonapi.org/format/

OR

2. Select a topic and work independently using ANY API documentation to create a quick example of the API. Be sure to comment out your code and take good notes. There are plenty to choose from!

Feel free to find examples of API usage on the web on Google to see examples of how such JSON would be created.
